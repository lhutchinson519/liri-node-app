# liri-node-app

This app uses API to connect with Twitter, Spotify, and IMDB and respond to the user command in node.js. Depending on the command typed, the console will display all tweets on my profile, information on a song searched with Spotify, in addition to returning movie information from IMDB. When the user types "do-what-it-says", the application will also run a specified file, read, and then run the command on the .text file to display in the console.
